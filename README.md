# LSystem

## What is LSystem?
A pure python module for generating iterations from the L-System or Lindenmayer system. 
Please check the [Wikipedia page on L-system][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system] for details.

The module gives you the `LSystem` class with the same structure as listed out on Wikipedia page (see the paragraph above). It gives you the following attributes:
* **variables** : A set of symbols that can be replaced
* **constants** : A set of symbols that won't be replaced
* **axiom**	: The initial state of the system.
* **rules**	: The rules for replacing variables with a combination of constants and variables.
* **system**	: A list of iterations that have been formed. The first member is, naturally, the axiom. The list can be expanded using the `iterate()` function member.



### A quick tutorial

```python
>>> from LSystem import LSystem # Import the LSystem class from the LSystem module
>>> ################################################
>>> # Algae will be an instance of LSystem
>>> # with 
>>> # 	variables being the list ['A', 'B']
>>> #	no constants 
>>> #	axiom 'A'
>>> #	rules A -> AB and B -> A
>>> ################################################
>>> Algae = LSystem(variables = "A B".split(), constants =[], axiom="A", rules={"A": "AB", "B":"A"})
>>> Algae
['A']
>>> Algae.variables
['A', 'B']
>>> Algae.constants
[]
>>> Algae.rules
{'A': 'AB', 'B': 'A'}
>>> Algae.axiom
'A'
>>> Algae
['A']
>>> Algae.iterate()
>>> Algae
['A', 'AB']
>>> Algae.iterate()
>>> Algae
['A', 'AB', 'ABA']
>>> Algae.system
['A', 'AB', 'ABA']
```
